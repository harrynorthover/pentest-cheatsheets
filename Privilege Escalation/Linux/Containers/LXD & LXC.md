# LXD/LSC Container
If we have a user with permissions to spin up a container, we can mount this to our file system and gain root access through it.

##### Execution 

1. [Check the user is in lxd group](obsidian://open?vault=Security%20%26%20PenTesting&file=Utils%2FLinux%2FBash). 

2. We need to create a new empty container based on the [Alpine](https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder) image.

	```
	git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder.git
	```

	```
	./build-alpine 
	```

3. If we have build this image on the attacking machine, we need to transfer it to the target.

4. Add it to the *lxd* group.

	```
	lxc image import alpine-v3.3-x86_64-20160114_2308.tar.gz --alias alpine-v3.3
	```
