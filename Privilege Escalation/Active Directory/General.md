# AD Directory Escalation
##### Introduction
Below is a checklist of permissions, groups, users and many other things to check for the look for a possible vector to use for lateral movement & escalation

##### [Weak ACLs](obsidian://open?vault=Security%20%26%20PenTesting&file=Privilege%20Escalation%2FActive%20Directory%2FAttacks%2FWeak%20ACLs)
We can exploit misconfigured ACLs of an account we have compromised to add/edit/change other AD users.

##### [DC Sync](obsidian://open?vault=Security%20%26%20PenTesting&file=Privilege%20Escalation%2FActive%20Directory%2FDCSync)
If we have access to a user that is a member of Administrators, Domain Admins, Enterprise Administrators or a write-Domain Controller. 

##### [DNSAdmin / DC](obsidian://open?vault=Security%20%26%20PenTesting&file=Privilege%20Escalation%2FActive%20Directory%2FAttacks%2FDNSAdmins%20DLL)
If we have access to a user that is a member of DNSAdmins, we can upload a malicious DLL.

##### [AD Recycle Bin](obsidian://open?vault=Security%20%26%20PenTesting&file=Privilege%20Escalation%2FActive%20Directory%2FAttacks%2FAD%20Recycle%20Bin)
If we have access to a user that is a member of Active Directory Recycle Bin, we can either restore users from the Bin, or at least list their credentials.

##### [SecretsDump](obsidian://open?vault=Security%20%26%20PenTesting&file=Privilege%20Escalation%2FActive%20Directory%2FAttacks%2FSecretsDump)
If we have access to a user that is a member of Domain Admins, we can access the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives, as well as dump the NTDS.DIT

##### [Pass The TIcket](obsidian://open?vault=Security%20%26%20PenTesting&file=Privilege%20Escalation%2FActive%20Directory%2FAttacks%2FPass%20The%20Ticket)

##### [Password Spraying](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/active-directory-password-spraying)
Spray a password against all AD accounts available.

##### Replace Registry Service
