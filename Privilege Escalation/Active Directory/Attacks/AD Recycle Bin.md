##### Requirements
We need access to a user who is a member of "Active Directory Recycle Bin". 

##### Execution
We can either try to restore an object from the RecycleBin, or if we don't have the correct permissions then list their permissions.

```
Get-ADObject -ldapFilter:"(msDs-lastKnownRDN=USER_ACCOUNT_NAME)" -IncludeDeletedObjects -property *
```

```
Get-ADObject -Filter {displayName -eq "DISPLAY_NAME"} -IncludeDeletedObjects | Restore-ADObject
```
