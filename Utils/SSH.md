# SSH
**Forward Port**

This lets us forward a local port to a report IP:PORT. We can access it using `127.0.0.1:LOCAL_PORT`

```
ssh -L LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT user@HOST_TARGET -fN
```

e.g.

```
ssh -L 8000:127.0.0.1:80 user@172.16.0.50 -fN
```

**Login With Key**

This allows us to login as a user with a key, which we could have copied from a SMB or such like.

```
chmod 600 id_rsa
```

```
ssh username@host -i id_rsa
```
