# Image Uploads 
**exiftool**
https://linux.die.net/man/1/exiftool
This allows us to inject server side code as part of the Comment field in image metadata. 

```
exiftool -Comment="<?php echo \"<pre>Test Payload</pre>\"; die(); ?>" test-USERNAME.jpeg.php
```

Then we can use an obfuscated payload from [Web Payloads](obsidian://open?vault=Security%20%26%20PenTesting&file=Access%2FWeb%2FPayloads) to gain a reverse shell. 

**Different File Signatures**
Change the file type use `hexedit` to one from here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures.

Remember, if you are adding an filetype to aa script file, add some new lines in first at the top.

```
hexedit FILE
```
