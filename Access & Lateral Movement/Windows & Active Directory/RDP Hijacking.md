# RDP Hijacking
When an administrator uses Remote Desktop to connect to a machine and closes the RDP client instead of logging off, his session will remain open on the server indefinitely. If you have SYSTEM privileges on Windows Server 2016 and earlier, you can take over any existing RDP session without requiring a password.

cmd.exe as Administrator


```shell-session
PsExec64.exe -s cmd.exe
```

```
query user
```
