# PenTest Cheatsheets

A collection of PenTest Cheatsheets created by Harry Northover. I've created these on my journey through [TryHackMe](http://tryhackme.com), [HackTheBox](http://hackthebox.com) and others. Hopefully leading to the eventual goal of the [OSCP Certification](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/)
