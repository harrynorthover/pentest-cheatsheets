# LDAP Enumeration

##### Introduction
LDAP stands for _Lightweight Directory Access Protocol._ It is an industry standard application protocol (RFC [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511)) that serves to define an interface or language with which client applications can talk to a directory service (such as OpenLDAP, Active Directory etc.) to query or modify the information in the directory.

An LDAP directory (or server) typically stores information about users, user credentials, groups, user memberships and so on. Since they act as a central repository for user information, they are commonly used for user authentication and authorization.
