# Kerbrute
Abusing Pre-Authentication. This does not trigger the login failed event.

**Get Users**
This will return us a list of users available to use, along with some basic information.

```
kerbrute -users USER_FILE -dc-ip IP -domain DOMAIN
```

Note: When nmap-ing, *DOMAIN* can be found under *DNS_Domain_Name*. USER_FILE is a generic list of user names to check against.

Always save this list to a .txt file!

We can then use [AS-REP Roasting](obsidian://open?vault=Security%20%26%20PenTesting&file=Hashes%20%26%20Password%20Cracking%2FBrute%20Force%2FActive%20Directory%2FAS-REP%20Roasting)
