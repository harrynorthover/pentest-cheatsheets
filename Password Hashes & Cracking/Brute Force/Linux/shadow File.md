# Cracking /etc/shadow
When we have access to both a *passwd* and *shadow* file, we can use john to crack it.

```
cat /etc/passwd
```

```
cat /etc/shadow
```

```
unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > unshadow.txt
```

```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=sha512crypt unshadow.txt
```
